i = start with the second element
compare with the previous
-> the idea is that, we want to arrange in ascending order
-> if the i > than the previous: move its pointer to the next.
-> if the i < than the previous : insert the element in the appropriate location

average = O(n^2)
worst case = O(n^2)
best case = O(n)

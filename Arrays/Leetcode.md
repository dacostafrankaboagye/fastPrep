
## 1480. Running Sum of 1d Array - Easy

  Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).
  
  Return the running sum of nums. 
  
  Example 1:
  
  Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
  Output: [1,3,6,10]
  Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].
  Example 2:
  
  Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1]
  Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
  Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+1, 1+1+1, 1+1+1+1, 1+1+1+1+1].
  Example 3:
  
  Input: nums = [3,1,2,10,1]
  Output: [3,4,6,16,17]
  
  Constraints:
  
  1 <= nums.length <= 1000
  -10^6 <= nums[i] <= 10^6

  ### Solution - java
  ```java

  /*
  decalre a variable - sum and int[] result
  loop through and add each nums[i] to sum -> then add it to result[]
  */
  
  class Solution {
  
      public int[] runningSum(int[] nums) {
          int[] result = new int[nums.length];
          int theSum = 0;
          for(int i=0; i<nums.length; i++){
              theSum += nums[i];
              result[i] = theSum;
          }
          return result;
      }
  }
  
  
  /*
  in place
  */
  class Solution {
  
      public int[] runningSum(int[] nums) {
          for(int i=1; i<nums.length; i++){
              nums[i] = nums[i-1] + nums[i];
          }
          return nums;
      }
  
  }
 ```
### Solution - python
  ```py
  
  class Solution:
      def runningSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
          for i in range(1, len(nums)):
              nums[i] = nums[i-1] + nums[i]
          return nums
  
  ```

## 2418. Sort the People - Easy

  You are given an array of strings names, and an array heights that consists of distinct positive integers. Both arrays are of length n.
  
  For each index i, names[i] and heights[i] denote the name and height of the ith person.
  
  Return names sorted in descending order by the people's heights.
  
  Example 1:
  
  Input: names = ["Mary","John","Emma"], heights = [180,165,170]
  Output: ["Mary","Emma","John"]
  Explanation: Mary is the tallest, followed by Emma and John.
  Example 2:
  
  Input: names = ["Alice","Bob","Bob"], heights = [155,185,150]
  Output: ["Bob","Alice","Bob"]
  Explanation: The first Bob is the tallest, followed by Alice and the second Bob.
   
  Constraints:
  
  n == names.length == heights.length
  1 <= n <= 103
  1 <= names[i].length <= 20
  1 <= heights[i] <= 105
  names[i] consists of lower and upper case English letters.
  All the values of heights are distinct.
  
  ### solution -python
  ```py
  
  class Solution:
      def sortPeople(self, names: List[str], heights: List[int]) -> List[str]:
          my_dict = { heights[i]:names[i]  for i in range(len(heights))}
          my_dict = dict(sorted(my_dict.items(), reverse=True))
          return my_dict.values()
          
        
  ```

## 2399. Check Distances Between Same Letters - Easy
You are given a 0-indexed string s consisting of only lowercase English letters,
where each letter in s appears exactly twice. 
You are also given a 0-indexed integer array distance of length 26.
Each letter in the alphabet is numbered from 0 to 25 (i.e. 'a' -> 0, 'b' -> 1, 'c' -> 2, ... , 'z' -> 25).
In a well-spaced string, the number of letters between 
the two occurrences of the ith letter is distance[i]. 
If the ith letter does not appear in s, then distance[i] can be ignored.

Return true if s is a well-spaced string, otherwise return false.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abaccb", distance = [1,3,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Output: true
Explanation:
- 'a' appears at indices 0 and 2 so it satisfies distance[0] = 1.
- 'b' appears at indices 1 and 5 so it satisfies distance[1] = 3.
- 'c' appears at indices 3 and 4 so it satisfies distance[2] = 0.
Note that distance[3] = 5, but since 'd' does not appear in s, it can be ignored.
Return true because s is a well-spaced string.

Example 2:

Input: s = "aa", distance = [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Output: false
Explanation:
- 'a' appears at indices 0 and 1 so there are zero letters between them.
Because distance[0] = 1, s is not a well-spaced string.
 
Constraints:

2 <= s.length <= 52
s consists only of lowercase English letters.
Each letter appears in s exactly twice.
distance.length == 26
0 <= distance[i] <= 50

### Solution - python
```py
class Solution:
    def checkDistances(self, s: str, distance: List[int]) -> bool:
        my_dict = {}
        for i in range(len(s)):
            letter = s[i]
            if letter in my_dict:
                calculated_distance = i - my_dict[letter] - 1
                distance_in_list = distance[ord(letter) - 97]
                if calculated_distance == distance_in_list:
                    my_dict.pop(letter)
                else:
                    return False
            else:
                my_dict[letter] = i
        if my_dict: return False
        else: return True
```
### Solution - java [converting the python code]
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean checkDistances(String s, int[] distance) {
        HashMap<Character, Integer> my_dict = new HashMap<>();
        for(int i=0; i<s.length(); i++){
            char letter = s.charAt(i);
            if(my_dict.containsKey(letter)){
                int calculated_distance = i - my_dict.get(letter) - 1;
                int distance_in_list = distance[(int)letter - 97];
                if(calculated_distance == distance_in_list){
                    my_dict.remove(letter);
                }else{
                    return false;
                }

            }else{
                my_dict.put(letter, i);
            }
        }
        if(my_dict.isEmpty()){
            return true;
        }else{
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```
